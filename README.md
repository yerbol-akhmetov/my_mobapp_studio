## Task
The task was to analyse the dataset from Google Play Store to evaluate the application market.

## Description
The problem is solved by downloading, cleaning, and processing the dataset. In addition, using Pandas library different interesting information about applications were retrieved from the dataset (e.g. mean average price of the application for each category, etc.)

## Installation
There is no explicit installation required. Jupyter notebook can be run and all required results can be observed. In addition, the "link_to_blog_post.txt" file contains the link to the blog post with all required histograms and diagrams.

## Usage
The analysis of the Google Play market is provided in the blog, where different releveant information is plotted in form of pie and bar charts. This information can be used for proper decision before uploading the application to Google Play Store.
